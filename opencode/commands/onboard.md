# Onboard New Project

Initialize a new project environment named **$ARGUMENTS**.

## Action Plan
1. **Load Skill**: Execute the `project-onboarding` skill immediately.
2. **Pathing**: Use the current working directory as the parent for the new project folder.
3. **Defaults**: Assume a Python tech stack and infrastructure-validation context.
4. **Execution**: Perform all `write` and `bash` operations allowed by your permissions without further confirmation.
